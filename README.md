A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) 
is a way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the web using standardized protocols. 
It enables the exchange of data between a client (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) and a server (e.g., a backend service) through HTTP requests.


Key Features of REST APIs:

Stateless Communication:

Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to process the request. 
The server does not store client state between requests.


Resource-Based:

REST APIs treat data as resources, each identified by a unique URL. 
For example, /users could represent a list of users, and /users/123 could represent a specific user with ID 123.


HTTP Methods:

REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources:


GET: Retrieve data.
POST: Create new data.
PUT: Update existing data.
DELETE: Remove data.
Format:
REST APIs often exchange data in lightweight formats like JSON or XML.


Uniform Interface:

REST APIs have a consistent and predictable structure, making it easier to use and understand.


Caching:

Responses can be cached to improve performance, reducing the need for repeated server calls.


Example:

Imagine an e-commerce app with a REST API:


GET /products: Retrieve a list of products.
POST /products: Add a new product to the inventory.
PUT /products/123: Update the details of product 123.
DELETE /products/123: Remove product 123 from the inventory.


Advantages of REST APIs:

Platform-agnostic.
Easy to use and widely supported.
Scalable and efficient for modern web applications.
REST APIs are commonly used in web and mobile app development to connect the frontend to the backend.
